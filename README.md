# captive
Evil Twin (Social Engineering)

Captive is a little script enabling you to deauth, spoof and redirect every host on an AP
Be sure that you can increase the power of your wifi interface otherwise the script won't be quite efficient
This script is specifically dedicated for a personnal use, DO NOT USE on on any AP that you don't own.
